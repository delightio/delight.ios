Delight IO
=========================

Basic Setup
-----------

1. Sign up on [http://delight.io](http://delight.io) to receive your app token.

2. Add Delight.framework to your target. Also make sure the following frameworks are linked:
    * AssetsLibrary
    * AVFoundation
    * CoreGraphics
    * CoreMedia
    * CoreVideo
    * QuartzCore
    * SystemConfiguration

3. In your build settings, add `-ObjC` to "Other Linker Flags".

4. In your application delegate, `#import <Delight/Delight.h>`. In `applicationDidFinishLaunching:withOptions:`, call `[Delight startWithAppToken:]` along with the app token obtained from step 1.

Advanced Setup
--------------

### Scale Factor ###

By default, recordings will be at 50% scale for iPhones and non-Retina iPads, and 25% scale for Retina iPads. These numbers were chosen to strike a balance between recording quality, performance and upload time. To record at a different scale, call `[Delight setScaleFactor:]` before `[Delight startWithAppToken:]`. The scale factor is a number between 0 and 1, for example 0.5 for 50% scale.

### Frame Rate ###

The frame rate will auto-adjust to become as high as possible. This may use up a lot of CPU, so you may want to reduce the frame rate to limit the effect on your app. To do so, call `[Delight setMaximumFrameRate:]` with the new maximum frame rate (in frames per second). You may need to experiment to find the right value. By default the maximum frame rate is 30 fps.

### Recording Control ###

Call `[Delight pause]` / `[Delight resume]` to temporarily pause recording. To stop recording altogether, call `[Delight stop]`.

### Saving to Photo Album ###

If you would like the video to be copied to the user's Photo Album after each recording, call `[Delight setSavesToPhotoAlbum:YES]`. By default the video is not copied.

### Recording the Camera ###

The front-facing camera can be recorded by calling `[Delight setRecordsCamera:YES]`. The camera recording will be uploaded along with the screen recording, and saved to the photo album if the `[Delight savesToPhotoAlbum]` option is enabled. Due to camera initialization the length of the camera recording may be slightly shorter than the length of the screen capture recording.

### Usability Test Mode ###

Usability test mode is a special mode where recording does not start automatically at the start of each session. Instead, the user must shake the device to start recording. An alert view will appear to confirm and allow the user to enter a short description of the test. To stop recording, the user must either shake the device again or press the home button.

To turn on usability test mode, call `[Delight setUsabilityTestEnabled:YES]` before `[Delight startWithAppToken:]`.

Private Views
-------------

### Registering / Unregistering ###

You may not want to record certain views, such as password prompts. Call `[Delight registerPrivateView:description:]` with a view and a descriptive text to make a view private (will appear blacked out in the recording). You must call `[Delight unregisterPrivateView:]` before the view is deallocated. `[Delight privateViews]` will return an NSSet of all private views currently registered.

### Hiding the Keyboard ###

To allow/prevent the keyboard from being recorded, call `[Delight setHidesKeyboardInRecording:]`. When set to YES, the keyboard area will be covered up by a grey box in the recording and keystroke gestures will not be drawn. By default, the keyboard is shown in the recording.

OpenGL ES Support
-----------------

Currently delight.io only supports UIKit apps. OpenGL ES support is in the works, however, and interested parties should email us at [opengl@delight.io](mailto:opengl@delight.io) to sign up for the beta.

Viewing Recordings
------------------

Log in to your control panel at [delight.io](http://delight.io) to view your recordings. You can filter your recordings by version and build, as defined in your application's Info.plist file. If you have turned on [saving to Photo Album](#saving-to-photo-album) you may also view recordings by launching the Photos app on the device.

Troubleshooting
---------------

* **Q**: Why do I get "Error creating pixel buffer:  status=-6661, pixelBufferPool=0x0"?

  **A**: The hardware-accelerated audio decoder may be blocking the video encoder. Try setting the audio session category to AVAudioSessionCategoryAmbient to use software audio decoding instead: `[[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setCategory:AVAudioSessionCategoryAmbient error:NULL];`

* **Q**: Why is my video rotated 90ยบ?

  **A**: The screen capturing operates at a window level rather than a view controller level. Windows in iOS are always in portrait mode; the view controllers take care of rotation. If your app is in landscape mode the video will therefore appear rotated. You can use the rotation control in the video player to rotate during playback.

* **Q**: How can I reach you for help and feedback?

  **A**: We would love to hear from you. Please tweet us [@delightio](http://twitter.com/delightio) or email us [feedback@delight.io](mailto:feedback@delight.io)
